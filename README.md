Hey folks, I'm Darian!

- I'm a third-and-final-year <b>Computer Science and Graphics</b> student at <b>Victoria University Of Wellington</b>, graduating 2023.
- Development wise, I love working on projects that enhance accessibility and useability, such as my Xbox Remote Script project.
- Beyond programming, I enjoy woodwork, gardening, and the odd video game session.
- I can be found on LinkedIn at: <br><b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darianisak/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/darianisak/</a></b>
